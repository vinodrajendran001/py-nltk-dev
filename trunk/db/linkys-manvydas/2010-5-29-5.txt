 The Pacaya Volcano erupted on Friday. It is located 50 kilometers south of the capital of Guatemala, Guatemala City. Throughout the evening and night, volcanic ash fell in the municipalities of Amatitl√°n, Villa Nueva, and Guatemala City.  President √?lvaro Colom 's government has decreed a State of Public Calamity in the Escuintla, Sacatep√©quez and Guatemala departments, for 15 days or more, so the authorities can do their job correctly. The emergency response is being coordinated by the National Coordination for Disaster Reduction (CONRED).  The eruption was followed by several tremors. All flights in and out of Guatemala City's La Aurora International Airport, have been suspended. The eruption has caused many casualties, among them the death of An√≠bal Archila, NOTI7's reporter, who was one of the first reporting the event.
