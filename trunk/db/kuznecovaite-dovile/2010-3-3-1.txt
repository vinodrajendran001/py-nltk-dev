 New York Representative Eric Massa announced Wednesday that he would be stepping down as Congressman from New York "s 29th congressional district . He cited health reasons for the sudden announcement. Massa is the latest in a string of United States Congresspeople to resign or not to seek reelection in 2010. He said that he had his third non-specific cancer recurrence in December 2009. He implied that his cancer is terminal, saying ‚Ä?I will now enter the final phase of my life at a more controlled pace.‚Äù He denied claims that his resignation is related to a sexual harassment accusation from a male aide. He said that this was untrue, although he admitted to using so called 'salty language'.
