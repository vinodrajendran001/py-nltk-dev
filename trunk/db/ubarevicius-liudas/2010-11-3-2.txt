Space Shuttle Discovery "s final launch on the STS-133 mission to the International Space Station has been delayed at least an additional day. Launch is now targeted for 3:29 PM EDT on Thursday.The launch was originally scheduled for this past Monday, but was delayed two days because of helium and nitrogen leaks on board the shuttle.Technicians are now working to repair technical glitches discovered yesterday on a main engine control computer.The weather outlook, however, appears to be unfavorable for the new targeted launch day; there is an 80 percent chance of undesirable weather, according to the NASA space shuttle weather officer Kathy Winters.The mission management team (MMT) is meeting today to discuss and troubleshoot Discovery"s newfound electrical problems.STS-133 is scheduled to be an 11-day mission to the International Space Station to ship supplies to the crew, as well as additional components for the orbital outpost"s construction, including the Permanent Multipurpose Module and the third of four ExPRESS Logistics Carriers . The mission is the 133rd of the Space Shuttle Program and the 39th of Discovery.' Final launch of Space Shuttle Discovery delayed another day ' — Wikinews , October 30, 2010
