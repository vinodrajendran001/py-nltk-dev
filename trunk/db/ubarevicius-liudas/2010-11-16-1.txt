Greg Biffle managed the fourth position, after starting fourth on the grid.

Hamlin, the current Drivers" championship leader, led 190 laps and finished twelfth. Following the race, Hamlin commented, 'Itâ€™s pretty disappointing. We were in a good position there heading into next week. We just have to outrace them next week. We had a good car today and it didnâ€™t work out strategy wise. We did what we had to do today we just didnâ€™t have it at the end. Itâ€™s frustrating. We had a car that could win and that is something weâ€™ve never had here. Weâ€™ll just go there next week and try to win the race. I donâ€™t know if we were trying to be smart or conservative there are really short.' 'I was sitting pretty,' Hamlin continued. 'I have to leave Phoenix in Phoenix. I canâ€™t control it. I did everything I could do today and it didnâ€™t work out. It could have been a lot worse. We could have lost the points lead and we didnâ€™t. Weâ€™ve had the best car in this Chase and might not win it. The full-court press will be on next week.'Going into the final race of the season, Hamlin remained the Drivers" championship leader with 6462 points, fifteen points ahead of Johnson in second, and 46 ahead of Harvick in third. This is the closest that the championship has been since the Chase format was introduced. The Manufacturers" Ñ?hampionship standings are led by Chevrolet with 255, 42 points ahead of Toyota and 88 ahead of Ford. Johnson commented, 'We had to work whatever magic we could at the end and now we have a points race heading to Miami . I know what my mindset is. I hope the pressure of being on Dennyâ€™s heels wears on him this week. One race winner take all, itâ€™s going to be a hell of a show.'
